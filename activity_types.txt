activity types:

specify which types of certain triggers execute our workflow
many trigger has multiple activity types which we can leverage

for eg in case of pull_request
there are mulitple activity types:
1. opened
2. synchronize
3. closed
4. assigned
5. labeled
6. edited

so eg:

on:
    pull_request:
        types: ['opened','synchronize']
        branch:
            - main
            - 'releases/**'

note: the activity types are in OR conditon!

note: for pull_request:[closed] and branches: [main] it would mean a PR merging 
INTO main where main is target
