access info about runs, variables, jobs and much more

github providers multiple sources of data in different contexts so that we can easily provide all necessary info to our workloads

eg

github:
1. commit SHA
2. event name
3. ref of branch or tag triggering the workflow

env:
contains variales that have been defined in a workflow, job or step. Chnages based on which part of the workflow is executing

inputs:
contains input properties passed via the keyword 'with' to an action to a reuable workflow or to a manually triggered workflow
eg with: version (in case of node)

vars:
contains custom configuration variables set at the organization, repository and environment levels

secrets:

matrix:

and many more

note: that every context cannot not be access from any part of the workflow
