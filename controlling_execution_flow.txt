execute jobs and steps conditonally and set dependeicnes between jobs



standard execution:
    - downstream jobs and steps only execute when upstream jobs and steps succeed
    - i.e no if condition



conditonal execution:
    - downstream jobs and steps can be executed even if upstream ones fail



# sequential job exection via the 'needs' key

1. non dependent execution: 
    all jobs are executed in parallel by default

2. dependent execution:
    jobs wait until their dependies successfully execute

eg jobs:
    job1:
    job2:
    job3:
        needs:
         - job1
         - job2
    job4:
        needs: job1 #so job4 will execute immeadiately once job1 is done unlike job 3 which needs both job 1 and 2
