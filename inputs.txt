inputs help privde info to customize workflows and actions

it enables us to request specific info from the okflow or action caller and use this info at runtime

eg 

inputs:
    demo-var:
        description:'..'
        required: true


to provide info to custom actions we use with keyword
note: inputs must be defined in the definition of resuable workflows
or custom action so that they can be correctly used

eg

jobs:
    job1:
        steps:
         - name: ping url
           uses:
            ping-url-example@v1
           with:
            url: https://www.wxample.com
            max-trials: 10

eg: while setting up node specifying target version
