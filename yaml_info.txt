note: if a value is defined for a key it cant have a child


note:
1. YAML layer (always applies)

GitHub Actions workflows are YAML files.

At the YAML level:

Single '...' and double "..." quotes both define strings

YAML itself does not care which one you use most of the time

name: 'Build'
name: "Build"
name: Build


All three are valid YAML strings.

Why quote at all in YAML?

You need quotes when:

The value contains : # {} []

The value starts with *, &, ?, -

You want to preserve spaces or special characters

run: "echo hello: world"

2. GitHub Actions expression layer

This applies to:

if:

${{ ... }}

env:

with:

matrix:

Here:

ONLY single quotes are used for strings

Double quotes are invalid
