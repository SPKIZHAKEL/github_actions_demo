It allows dynamic names using variables, like branch names, commit messages, PR numbers, etc.

Example:

run-name: "Build by ${{ github.actor }} on ${{ github.ref_name }}"


This shows up as the name of the specific run, e.g.:

Build by alice on feature/login

run-name can be customized per run, while name cannot.

✅ name: (workflow name)

Defines the name of the workflow itself, as it appears in the GitHub Actions tab.

Example:

name: CI Pipeline


This shows up here:
Actions → CI Pipeline

It is static and does not change per run (unless you edit the workflow file).

name: Deploy App
run-name: "Deploy triggered by ${{ github.actor }} on ${{ github.ref_name }}"
