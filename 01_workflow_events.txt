triggering workflows in multiple ways:

1. repository event:
    push
    issues
    pull_request
    pull_request_review
    fork

2. manual trigger:
    triggered via the UI - triggered by the actions tab in github
    triggered via an api call 
    triggered via another workflow

3. schedule:
    runs as a cron job

    note: there can more than 1 trigger event for one workflow. need to use array in such case


note: In GitHub Actions YAML, the - character indicates a list item (sequence entry).
note: 6 digit cron gives error
