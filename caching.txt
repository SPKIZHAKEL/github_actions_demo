Caching -
speed up workflows runs by caching stable file
it allows to store files and retrieve them based on a key.  
workflpw can access the cache from their brnach or from default branch

worlflow:
wroflow run starts-> execute cache step -> cache matching key? if yes-> restore cache
if no-> then install dependencies

When is the cache reused?

Only when the cache key matches.

key: ubuntu-latest-npm-<hash>

Same key → cache reused
Different key → new cache created
Real example with dependencies
First run
key: ubuntu-latest-npm-AAA


Cache does not exist → create it.

Second run (same deps)
key: ubuntu-latest-npm-AAA


Cache exists → reuse it.

After adding a dependency

package-lock.json changes → hash changes:

key: ubuntu-latest-npm-BBB


Old cache not reused → new cache created.
