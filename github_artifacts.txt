Artifacts:

Share data between hobs and store data after workflows are completed

#Artifacts:
- sotred for up to 90- days
- managed by 2 actions - upload artifact
download artifact

note: upload and download are in SAME WORKFLOW

- we need artifacts when stored file are liekly to be accessed OUTSIDE the workflow for eg -
eg build outputs
test results
logs



#Caching:
stored abt 7 days
managed by a single action - cache
recommend when stoed files need to be accessed only WITHIN the workflow
eg build dependencies

Exact flow (step by step)
1️⃣ Files exist on the runner

After actions/checkout, your runner has:

Runner filesystem ($GITHUB_WORKSPACE)
└── 14-artifacts/react-app/build/
    ├── index.html
    └── static/

2️⃣ upload-artifact runs

This step:

uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4


Reads the files from the runner filesystem

Compresses them

Uploads them to GitHub’s artifact storage

3️⃣ Where they live after upload

They are stored:

In GitHub Actions Artifacts

Associated with that workflow run

Under the artifact name:

app


You can find them:

GitHub repo → Actions

Click the workflow run

Scroll to Artifacts

Download app

What happens after the job ends

The runner is destroyed

Files on the runner are gone

The artifact remains in GitHub storage

By default:

Artifacts are kept for 90 days (configurable)
