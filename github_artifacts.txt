Artifacts:

Share data between hobs and store data after workflows are completed

#Artifacts:
- sotred for up to 90- days
- managed by 2 actions - upload artifact
download artifact

note: upload and download are in SAME WORKFLOW

- we need artifacts when stored file are liekly to be accessed OUTSIDE the workflow for eg -
eg build outputs
test results
logs



#Caching:
stored abt 7 days
managed by a single action - cache
recommend when stoed files need to be accessed only WITHIN the workflow
eg build dependencies
