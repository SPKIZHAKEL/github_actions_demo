workflow runners are virtual servers that execute jobs from workflows
there are 2 types:
1. github-hosted (standard):
    windows and ubuntu - 2 cores, 7 gb ram, 14 stroage
    it is a managed service 
    a vm is scoped to a job: steps shared the VM but jobs dont
    so each job receives a clean VM instance

2. self hosted runners
    runs workflows on any infra of ur chouce
    full control over VM infra
    its not managed, meaning we need to take care of OS patching
    can be added at the repository, organization or enterprise level
    jobs do not necessarily hve to run o clean instnces
