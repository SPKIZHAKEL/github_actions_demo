Event filters:
specify under what conditon the specifc event 
triggers our workflow. most triggers can be confgured to specify when they should run

for eg for push event u can have 
1. branches - specifies which brnaches must match in order for workflow to execute
    eg branches:
        - main
        - 'releases/**' #should match pattern
       paths-ignore:
        - 'docs/**' # any changes to docs should not trigger anything
