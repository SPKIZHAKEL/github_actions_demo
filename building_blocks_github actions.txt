broadly:

workflows-> jobs -> steps

# WORKFLOW:

    defined at repo level.
    define which triggers start the workflows
    are composed of 1 or more jobs

# JOBS 
    are defined at the workflow level
    define in which execution env they run
    are composed of one or more steps
    run in parallel by default

#STEPS

    are defined at the job level
    define the actual script or github action that will be executed
    run sequentially by default (if u want stuff to be in parallel the JOB has to be parallel)


    note: jobs run in separate machines 


note: they keys of the same object should be at the same indentation

note: when defining multi line script u need to use '|'

by default if a step fails the job and hence workflow is consdiered fail and by default the next step is not executed
