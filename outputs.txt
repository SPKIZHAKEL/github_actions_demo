outputs

output data from jobs for later usage

we need an id field in the step to indicate 
later in the output which step details are needed

so overall u need to:
1. define an id for the step
2. echo key-value pairs (by which u want to referene the output) into $GITHUB_OUTPUT variable, which github actions will reference for outputs
   once the job is done

3. mention the outputs in the outputs section of the job
4. list the job as a dependency of a job that needs the output
5. acccess the output in the other job using needs.context

eg 
jobs:
    welcome:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        outputs:
            name: ${{steps.step1.outputs.NAME}} #NAME is the key defined below
        steps:
            - id: step1
              run: echo "NAME=Jimmy" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
    
    goodbye:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        needs: welcome
        steps:
         - run: echo "Bye,  ${{needs.welcome.outputs.name}}"


NOTE: STEPS DO NOT SHARE THE SAME GIHUB ACTIONS FILE
IF U OUTPUT $GITHUB_OUTPUT FOR ANY 2 STEPS u will see hash value in the path is different
hence overwriting the GITHUB_OUTPUT in one file doesnt affect the other
